It also relates to a persistent lack of clean water in a certain region. Finally, desertification is enhanced by antrophic factors, as deforestation and unsustainable use of water, which furthers climate change. \n",

    "Our goal is thus to keep track the advance of desertification in Brazil. This can be measured by evapotranspiration indices and can be validated by weather station data.
